There are a wide variety of use-cases ElasticCode can address, a few of which are listed below.

1. **Enterprise Workflow Automation** - ElasticCode can design and execute dynamic workflows across heterogenous enterprise, leveraging a variety of data sources and services.
2. **High Performance Computing** - ElasticCode's support for real-time streaming compute and parallel workflow execution lends itself to big-data and compute intensive tasks.
3. **Enterprise DevOps** - DevOps involves automated and repeatable pipelines for building software assets. ElasticCode's flow models and distributed compute is a perfect fit for custom DevOps.
4. **IoT and Factory Automation** - Orchestrating across connected devices or machinery in a factory is easy to model with ElasticCode due to it's dynamic and ad hoc workflow capability. Custom scripting allows for easy integration into existing device APIs.
5. **AI & Machine Learning Modelling** - Generating effective AI models requires obtaining and cleaning data from various sources, feature extraction, merging and training epochs. This is naturally a multi-step process that can be done visually with ElasticCode's visual modelling tools.
6. **Simulation** - Simulation seeks to model real world processes and given a set of inputs, determine or predict certain target variables. These models are typically designed as a network of connected dependencies or entities along with environmental conditions that affect the simulation.
7. **Decision Systems & Analytics** - State-transition modelling is technique used at major companies that have to make important stochastic financial decisions using key business metrics. ElasticCode's visual modeling and streaming compute capability allow for such models to be easily designed and customized, fully integrating into company databases, spreadsheets, accounting systems or other data sources.
